# Mainly Sweat, Blood and Tears, or Urine, but sweat is probably the easiest to work with.

Wrote the [tds-xiao.ino](tds-xiao.ino) Total Disswolved Solids, sort of conductivity for sweat using the Seeeduino XIAO and the [Gravity TDS](https://ca.robotshop.com/products/gravity-analog-tds-sensor-meter-arduino?gclid=CjwKCAiA3KefBhByEiwAi2LDHHJV5fP53EyUkg7YmMkmIBnG2JrvVo-PCU_DIchM7DoN59APMx-2rBoCAJsQAvD_BwE) it works, so making a case for it.

First, who are the main players in Na, K wearables, what labs which people?

Would any of them send a few wearables for a High School Robotics Machine Learning club to study?
